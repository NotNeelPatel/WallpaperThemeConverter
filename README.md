### A webpage that converts any image to any colour palette.

Adjust the colours to a wallpaper to better match your setup, terminal, and/or IDE! Use theme presets such as:

- [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)
- [Nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord)
- [Everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest)
- [Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized)
- [Dracula](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme)
- [Tokyo Night](https://github.com/tokyo-night/tokyo-night-vscode-theme)
- [Kanagawa](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim)
- [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin)
- [Ros√© Pine](https://github.com/rose-pine/rose-pine-theme)
- Custom Theme (add your own colours!)

Inspired by [Gruvbox Factory](https://github.com/paulopacitti/gruvbox-factory) and [ImageGoNord](https://github.com/Schrodinger-Hat/ImageGoNord)

## Examples

![this took way too long](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91706742/167540042-26458707-ff23-413e-bce1-2141b562fc1e.png)

Note: There are more themes than just the ones listed here.

## Instructions

1. Drag/Drop an image or click on "Browse" to select your image.
2. Select a theme.
3. If you want to do a custom theme, select "Custom Theme" and press the + button to add colours. Click on the colour swatch (the black block) and change the colour to whatever you'd like. Press "Done" when you are ready.
4. Press "Convert"
5. Wait! It may take a few seconds, especially if you have lower-end hardware. You will know that it is done when you see the "Download" button and "Reset Image" button.
6. Download the image if you'd like, or if you want to try another palette, press "Reset Image" and repeat steps 3-5.

## How it works

I wrote a blog post in 2022 explaining more about how it works. Check it out: [https://notneelpatel.github.io/blog/2022-05-10-wallpaper-theme-converter.html](https://notneelpatel.github.io/blog/2022-05-10-wallpaper-theme-converter.html)
