# [Wallpaper Theme Converter](https://notneelpatel.github.io/projects/wallpaper-theme-converter)

### A webpage that converts any image to any colour palette.

Adjust the colours to a wallpaper to better match your setup, terminal, and/or IDE! Use theme presets such as:

- [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)
- [Nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord)
- [Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized)
- [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) (Thanks [Marcus](https://github.com/cheezytaco101)!)
- [Dracula](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme)
- Custom Theme (add your own colours!)

## Instructions

1. Drag/Drop an image or click on "Browse" to select your image.
2. Select a theme.
3. If you want to do a custom theme, select "Custom Theme" and press the + button to add colours. Click on the colour swatch (the black block with the white outline) and change the colour to whatever you'd like. Press "Done" when you are ready.
4. Press "Convert"
5. Wait!! It may take a few seconds, especially if you have lower-end hardware. You will know that it is done when you see the "Download" button and "Reset Image" button.
6. Download the image if you'd like, or if you want to try another palette, press "Reset Image" and repeat steps 3-5.
